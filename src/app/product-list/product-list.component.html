<h2>Products</h2>

<!-- *ngFor is a "structural directive".
  Structural directives shape or reshape the DOM's structure,
  typically by adding, removing, and manipulating the elements to which they are attached.
  Directives with an asterisk, *, are structural directives. -->

<!-- With *ngFor, the <div> repeats for each product in the list. -->
<div *ngFor="let product of products">
  <!-- display the names of the products using interpolation syntax {{ }}
  Interpolation renders a property's value as text -->
  <h3>
    <!-- set title to be the product's name using property binding [ ] syntax
    property binding [ ] lets you use the property value in a template expression -->
    <a [title]="product.name + ' details'">
      {{ product.name }}
    </a>
  </h3>

  <!-- use an *ngIf directive so that Angular only creates the <p> element if the current product has a description -->
  <p *ngIf="product.description">Description: {{ product.description }}</p>

  <!-- bind the click event to share() method (in product-list.component.ts)
  event binding uses a set of parentheses, ( ), around the event -->
  <button (click)="share()">Share</button>
  <!-- pass the current product as input to the component using property binding -->
  <app-product-alerts [product]="product"> </app-product-alerts>
</div>
